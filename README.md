# jtketz/learningtocode
A public documentary of me learning to code.
The goal is to update daily, starting with the 100 days of code challenge. 
I am not starting from zero as I have some experience through an engineering degree or two. 

## Contents and Quick Note
Detailed below will be my approach and documenting my progress as I go. 
All code made available here is my own related to the contents of publically available courses that are free to access.
This document is entirely for educational purposes. 
This code will not be pretty and is updated as I go, no promises that any of it will work.
